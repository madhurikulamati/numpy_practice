# NumPy Practice Programs (Jupyter Notebook)

This repository contains my beginner-level practice programs for **NumPy**
using **Jupyter Notebook**.  
The notebooks focus on understanding **NumPy array creation and basic
operations**, which form the foundation for data analysis and scientific
computing in Python.

Each notebook includes clear examples with outputs to make learning and
revision easier.
